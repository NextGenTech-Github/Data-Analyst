Statistics

1. Basic Descriptive Statistics: Functions like mean, median, mode, stdev, and variance are essential for summarizing data.
2. Distribution Analysis: Functions from scipy.stats such as norm, ttest_ind, and pearsonr are used for more advanced statistical analyses.
3. Data Manipulation and Visualization: numpy and pandas are critical for data manipulation, while libraries like matplotlib and seaborn are used for visualization.
