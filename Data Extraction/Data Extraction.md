For extracting data from different sources using Python, a mind map would be an effective way to visualize the overall strategy, including the main tools and libraries involved, data sources, and the process steps. This visualization can help organize the components and clarify the flow of tasks. Let's create a mind map to illustrate this concept.

Title: Data Extraction Strategy

STEP 1: Python Libraries
    Requests
        HTTP requests to web pages
    BeautifulSoup
        Parsing HTML and XML documents
    Scrapy
        Web crawling & scraping
    Pandas
        Data manipulation and analysis

STEP 2: Data Sources
    Web Pages
    APIs
    Databases
    Files (CSV, Excel, JSON)

STEP 3: Process Steps
    Identify Data Source
    Fetch Data
    Parse and Clean
    Store or Process Data
